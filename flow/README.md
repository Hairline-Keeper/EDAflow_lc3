## EDAflow_lc3-OpenRoadFlow
![alt text](docs/flow.png "flow")

## Quick Start
```
# Implement the example gcd design
cd flow
make

# check the GDS
klayout results/nangate45/gcd/6_final.gds
```
The resulting GDS will be available at `flow/results/nangate45/gcd/6_final.gds`

## Designs
Sample design configurations are available in the `designs` directory. You can
select a design using either of the following methods:
1. The flow [Makefile](Makefile) contains a list of sample design configurations
   at the top of the file. Uncomment the respective line to select the design
2. Specify the design using the shell environment, e.g.
   `make DESIGN_CONFIG=./designs/nangate45/swerv.mk` or
   `export DESIGN_CONFIG=./designs/nangate45/swerv.mk; make`
By default, the simple design gcd is selected. We recommend implementing this
design first to validate your flow and tool setup.

### Adding a New Design
To add a new design, we recommend looking at the included designs for examples
of how to set one up.

## Platforms
EDAflow_lc3-OpenRoadFlow supports Verilog to GDS for the following open platforms:
* Nangate45 / FreePDK45

These platforms have a permissive license which allows us to redistribute the
PDK and OpenROAD platform-specific files. The platform files and license(s) are
located in `platforms/{platform}`.

EDAflow_lc3-OpenRoadFlow also supports the following commercial platforms:
* TSMC65LP
* GF14 (in progress)

The PDKs and platform-specific files for these kits cannot be provided due to
NDA restrictions. However, if you are able to access these platforms, you can
create the necessary platform-specific files yourself.

Once the platform is setup. Create a new design configuration with information
about the design. See sample configurations in the `design` directory.


### Adding a New Platform
At this time, we recommend looking at the [Nangate45](platforms/nangate45) as an
example of how to set up a new platform for EDAflow_lc3-OpenRoadFlow.

## Implement the Design
Run `make` to perform Verilog to GDS. The final output will be located at
`flow/results/{platform}/{design_name}/6_final.gds`
