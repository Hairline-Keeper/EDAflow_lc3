# EDAflow_lc3
EDAflow_lc3 is an EDA tool chain provided to courses of the School of Computer Software at Shenzhen University, which has been able to correctly generate GDS for [chisel_lc3](https://github.com/Hairline-Keeper/chisel_lc3).The original project was OpenRoad-Flow.You can get more information by looking at [OpenRoad-flow-public README](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/EDAflow_lc3-public/blob/master/README.md).

## Code Organization
This repository serves as an example RTL-to-GDS flow using the OpenROAD tools.
The two main components are:
1. **tools**: This directory contains the source code for the entire `openroad`
   app (via submodules) as well as other tools required for the flow. The script
   `build_openroad.sh` in this repository will automatically build the OpenROAD
   toolchain.

2. **flow**: This directory contains reference recipes and scripts to run      |
   designs through the flow. It also contains platforms and test designs.

## Setup
The flow has the following dependencies:
* OpenROAD
* KLayout
* TritonRoute
* Yosys

The dependencies can either be obtained from a pre-compiled build export or
built manually. See the [KLayout website](https://www.klayout.de/) for
installation instructions.

### Option 1: Building the tools using docker
This build option leverages a multi-step docker flow to install the tools and
dependencies to a runner image. To follow these instructions, you must have
docker installed, permissions to run docker, and docker container network access
enabled. This step will create a runner image tagged as `openroad/flow`.
1.  Clone the EDAflow_lc3 repository
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Hairline-Keeper/EDAflow_lc3.git
```
2. Ensure your docker daemon is running and `docker` is in your PATH, then run
the docker build.
```
./build_openroad.sh
```
3. Start an interactive shell in a docker container using your user credentials
```
docker run -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) openroad/flow bash
```

### Option 2: Building the tools locally
1. Recommend CentOS7 or Ubuntu20 to build

a. CentOS7 : Reference the Dockerfiles and READMEs for the separate tools on the build steps and dependencies.
```
EDAflow_lc3/tools/OpenROAD/Dockerfile
EDAflow_lc3/tools/yosys/Dockerfile
EDAflow_lc3/tools/TritonRoute/Dockerfile
```
b. Ubuntu20 : Reference the following command
```
apt install build-essential
apt install tcl-dev
apt install libreadline6-dev
apt install bison
apt install flex
apt install libffi-dev
apt install cmake
apt install libboost-all-dev
apt install swig
apt install klayout
```
See the [KLayout](https://www.klayout.de) instructions for installing KLayout from source.

2. Run the build script
```
cd EDAflow_lc3
./build_openroad.sh
```
3. Update your shell environment
```
source setup_env.sh
```
`klayout` must be added to the path manually.

## Checking the environment
```
yosys -h
openroad -h
TritonRoute -h ("Error reading param file!!!" is acceptable)
klayout -h
```

## Using the flow
See the flow [README](flow) for details about the flow and how
to run designs through the flow
